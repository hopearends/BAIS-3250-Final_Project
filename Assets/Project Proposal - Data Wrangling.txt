Project ProposalNFL Statistics & AttendanceHope Arends & Natalie MeherIntroduction:NFL games are becoming increasingly popular among families and fans. In this project, we will look at NFL statistics and how attendance is affected by those statistics. Are fans loyal? Or do they only like to watch when their team is good? We plan to use a data set found from Kaggle alongside attendance data found on ESPN.com to analyze how and what football statistics affect in-person attendance. Data:The first data source that we will use is a pre-existing dataset named ‘team_stats_2003_2023.csv’ from Kaggle. Data contained within the source was obtained by Nick Cantalupa by using Python BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium Webdriver to pull the html data from www.pro-football-reference.com.  The data file contains data on 672 teams across 21 seasons, from 2003 through 2023. We also plan to scrape data from ESPN, which contains fan attendance data for every NFL team. This data will be scraped using Selenium Webdriver and only the relevant information for our project from the overall section. This includes the overall number of games, the overall fan attendance total, and the average fan attendance for every game. As our attendance data from ESPN will have to be scraped by each year, these will be saved in separate datasets. We will then combine the datasets using team and only the data with the already existing teams from Kaggle will be used. Doing this will allow us to accurately obtain answers to the project questions. Data DictionaryFieldTypeSourceDescriptionyearNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe year of that season teamTextteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe name of the NFL teamwinsNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe number of wins in a seasonlossesNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe number of losses in a seasonwin_loss_percFloatteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe percentage of wins or losses in a seasonpointsNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe number of points scored total in a seasonpoints_oppNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe number of points opponents scored against the team in a season.points_diffNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe difference between points and points_opp in a season.movFloatteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe average margin of victory.gNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe number of games played in a season.total_yardsNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe number of yards totals in a season. plays_offenseNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe number of plays on offense in a season.yds_per_play_offenseFloatteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe average amount of yards per play in a season. turnoversNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of turnovers in a season. fumbles_lostNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of fumbles in a season. first_downNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of first downs in a season. pass_cmpNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of passes completed in a season. pass_attNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of passes attempted in a season.pass_ydsNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of pass yards in a season. pass_tdNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of pass touchdowns in a season.pass_intNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of interceptions in a season. pass_net_yds_per_attFloatteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of times possession is lost from fumbling the ball in a seasonpass_fdNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of passing first downs in a season rush_attNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of rush attempts in a season. rush_ydsNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of rush yards in a season. rush_tdNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of rush touchdowns in a season. rush_yds_per_attFloatteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total rushing yards per attempt in a season. rush_fdNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of rushing first downs in a season. penaltiesNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of penalties in a season.penalties_ydsNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of yards from penalties in a season.pen_fdNumericteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of penalty first downs in a season. score_pctFloatteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe scoring percentage in a season. turnover_pctFloatteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe turnover percentage in a season. exp_pts_totFloatteam_stats_2003_2023.csvExpected points total in a season.tiesFloatteam_stats_2003_2023.csvThe total number of ties in a season.rankNumericESPNThe rank of the team based on attendance in a season.teamTextESPNThe name of the NFL teamoverall_gmsNumericESPNThe total number of games played in a season. overall_total_fan_attNumericESPNThe total number of attendees in a season. overall_avg_fan_attNumericESPNThe total average number of attendees per game in a season.Proposed Analysis: This project is aimed to analyze the effects of common football statistics, such as record, touchdowns, total yards, and turnovers on attendance. Our research questions include:1. What teams have seen an increase in attendance over the years? 2. Is there a strong correlation between the winning percentage of a team and the attendance for that year? Does there seem to be higher attendance when teams are winning more?3. What team has seen the highest attendance over the last 3 years? Specifically, what are the three teams that have seen the best attendance over the last three years? 4. Is there a strong correlation between turnovers and attendance in that year?
